# Web Practicing Projects

A not so long list with some projects I've made when I was learning web development and having fun writing JavaScript.

Proceed with **caution**, you may see hostile things like `float: left;` (it scares you just to think of I know) and the use of `px` for `font-size` so, be **aware**.
